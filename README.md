# Learning Pyqt5


## Import! Read First 

only code in project-* is maintained when I am still working on this repo; other folder's example may or maynot runnable!

If you happen to come here, only check project-promodoro as a valid reference for the pyqt5 code, and other files will not worthy checking unless you would like to check the code correctneess by yourself!


## Project Strcuture

- folders
  - example* -> container example and playing around stuff
  - some folders have explicit name to tell what I was experimenting


- project-xxxx
  - the current main project
  - entry file: main.py
    - two dependencies files:
      - Promodoro.py and its Ui file
      - DragDrop.py and its Ui file
  - backup folder is just like its name said
  - play-around-file folder is just like its name said

## How to run the main project

just `python main.py` in the project-rpomodoro folder
